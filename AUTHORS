The authors of Sexpr:

* Scott Lawrence <yorgle@gmail.com> wrote the "lithp" interpreter
  which was used as the basis for the tiny Lisp interpreter in C Zile.

* Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org> translated the code from C that
  formed the Lisp interpreter for Lua Zile.

* David Bergman <davber@gmail.com> wrote lualisp, which influenced the
  design of lambda and defmacro in Sexpr.

* Gary V. Vaughan <gary@gnu.org> wrote Sexpr from scratch, designed
  to be a drop in replacement for the toy Lisp implementation in Lua
  Zile, but to be a fully functional Lisp.
